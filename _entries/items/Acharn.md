name: Acharn

This elven helm was crafted by an elf of Menegroth after The Battle Of A Thousand Caves. It is a work of great craft, engraved on one side with the profile of Húrin and on the other with the profile of Thingol. The engravings are ingeniously etched such that depending on the light they may appear either as life-like warriors or dead and decaying corpses.

The helm was named after Húrin's exclamation before leaving the land of Hithlum: "Tôl acharn!" ("Vengeance comes!") and would literally translate as "(and act of) vengeance." It is a memento mori, a reminder of both the power and danger of vengeance.

It has these properties. Only the first is active until upgraded when increasing Valour or contributing to the treasury of a people during a fellowship phase.

- Ancient Cunning Make (1 Load or 0 Load if Valour is 4 or higher)
- Ancient Close Fitting (add 3 or Valour to Protection rolls, whichever is higher)

Acharn has two additional special abilities which are always active:

- The bearer treats their Wisdom as one higher for Shadow Tests.
- If the bearer's Shadow score reaches their maximum Hope they may relinquish Acharn, leaving it for fate to decide its next owner, instead of having a bout of madness. Acharn will never be seen by that bearer again.

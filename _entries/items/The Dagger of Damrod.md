name: The Dagger of Damrod
---

The dagger used by Damrod to slay Gnarsh. It is a subtly curved dagger of Númenórean make, artfully embellished with etchings like waves coming to shore.

It has these qualities:
* Against orcs and trolls, when a Piercing Blow is scored the PROTECTION test is _ill-favored._ If the roll was already _ill-favored_ for any reason, then the Piercing Blow scores an automatic Wound instead.

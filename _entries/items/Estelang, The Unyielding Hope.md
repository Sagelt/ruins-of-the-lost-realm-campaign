name: Estelang, The Unyielding Hope
---

A blade forged by an ancestor of [[Nob]] in his quest to destroy [[Amon Gurutholos]]. It is crudely made and run through with strange black veins, almost as if charred, but despite its appearance the blade is a powerful piece of Númenórean craft.

It has these qualities:
* Superior Fell
* Superior Greivous
* Keen
* When wielded against undead it removes their Heartless ability and makes them Craven instead (when affected by the Intimidate Foe combat task the creature also loses 1 hate).

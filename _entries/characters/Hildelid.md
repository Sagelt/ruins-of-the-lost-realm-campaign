A former adventurer, Hildelid protected the farmsteads around [[The Last Bridge]] from bandit raids. Her valor brought her sorrow as well, as her husband and daughter were thought slain in a raid. Unbeknownst to Hildelid they were not slain but taken captive and her daughter, [[Norwinda]], eventually became the chief of the band of hillfolk that made their home in [[Fort Arlas]].

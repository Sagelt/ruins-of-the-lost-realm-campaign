Once a well-to-do resident of [[Tharbad]], Diarmoc and his family fled the city as refugees after the flooding of 2967. They were captured by trolls and Diarmoc was forced to work with [[Jari]] to con more people into coming to the valley to feed the trolls.

In 2968 Diarmoc and his family relocated to [[Lond Daer]].

An elf of Lindon. Has served Círdan and Mithrandir as a messenger across Eriador for a thousand years.

In spring 2965 Ithildir gazed into the [[Elendil Stone]] at [[The White Towers]] and received three visions:
* Eriador emptied of anything ancient and valuable
* War with the wild folk
* A blindfolded Black Númenórean looking out over the valley of Rivendell

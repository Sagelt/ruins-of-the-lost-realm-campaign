name: Tharbad

Once a great city of the Númenóreans, time has not been kind to Tharbad. Now mostly ruins ruled by [[Captain Gurnow]] who rules with an iron fist there are few left in the city. The Bridge Inn, run by [[Titus]] is a bastion of hospitality, but otherwise the city is a crumbling shell. Craftspeople such as [[Milton the Brewer]] are forced to live on the middle island and not allowed to leave it without Gurnow's leave.

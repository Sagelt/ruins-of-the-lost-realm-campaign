name: Fort Arlas
---

The ancient fort built around the Arlas Tree, the oldest willow in all of Eriador. The roots of the tree still hold the bones of Damrod the DÃºnadan and Gnarsh One-Eye whose legendary battle ended under Arlas. Fort Arlas fell into disuse and became a camp for hillfolk until the great spider Dolomedia drove them off and laid her eggs there.

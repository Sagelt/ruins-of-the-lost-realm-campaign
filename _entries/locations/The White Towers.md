name: The White Towers

An outpost of the Elves of Lindon, the White Towers hold a relic of a bygone age: a palantír.

The three towers are:
* Astirion, the custodian tower. Home to the caretaker of the tower which is currently [[Braswen]].
* Nadirion, the guest tower.
* Elostirion, the seeing tower, which holds the palantír known as the [[Elendil Stone]].
